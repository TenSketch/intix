        <meta name="description" content="Events listing and tour planning. Intix believes in creating memories together. We encourages people to spend time together in events and tours rather than people going for movies together. By doing this, we create memories and social strength. We support people spending time with each other either by going places and events happening in and around their city. Whenever people want to step out of their home, we should find intix.in as a one stop solution for planning and organizing your time of leisure, weekend or holiday. This is cool!">
